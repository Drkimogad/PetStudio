# PetStudio Web App:

App overview:
PetStudio is a simple web application that allows users to sign up, log in, create pet profiles, and manage a collection of pet information. The app functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA), storing user data locally for offline use.

Key Features:
Sign-Up and Login:

Users can sign up by providing a username and password, which are saved to localStorage.
After signing up, they can log in using the saved credentials.

Upon successful login, users are redirected to the Dashboard where they can create and manage pet profiles.
Create and Manage Pet Profiles:

Users can create profiles for their pets by entering:
Pet Name
Breed
Date of Birth (DOB)
Pet Photos (via file upload)
Birthday Reminder Date
All pet profiles are stored in localStorage as a list and rendered on the dashboard.
View Pet Profiles:

Each pet profile is displayed with the following information:
Name
Breed
Date of Birth
Birthday Reminder
Photos
Users can view, delete, and print pet profiles:
Delete: Removes the pet profile from the list and updates localStorage.
Print: Allows users to print the pet profile without the delete or print buttons.

Data Persistence:
All pet profiles and user login credentials are saved to localStorage, ensuring data persistence even after closing and reopening the browser.
